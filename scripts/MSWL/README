This is a variation on the original MSW (multiple sequential wrapper)
package.  This one reads commands from a file, and runs them in parallel.  
This version is for Jacquard.

This MPI wrapper source file (mswl.c) can be compiled using the script 
"ccmswl", which produces an MPI executable named "mswl".

README  ccmswl  command_list  mswl.c  runmswl.pbs  runseq.csh

There is a batch script named "runmswl.pbs" that shows an example of how to 
use "mswl":

#PBS -l nodes=3:ppn=2,walltime=00:10:00
#PBS -N mswl
#PBS -o mswl.out
#PBS -e mswl.err
#PBS -q debug 
#PBS -V

cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
mpirun -np 6 ./mswl command_list

The above batch job creates six processes.  One of these acts as a 
"master", and the other five act as "slaves".  The master will read
each line from the file "command_list", and pass it to a waiting
slave.  The slave will then attempt to execute the command line.
Typically, this will be an invocation of a shell script with optional
arguments.

Note that the master does no work, other than coordinating the work
of the slaves.

For optimal load balancing, the list of commands should be sorted
longest-running to shortest-running, if that information is available.

In the above example, the file command_list contains:

./runseq.csh 1 A
./runseq.csh 2 B
./runseq.csh 3 C
./runseq.csh 4 D
./runseq.csh 5 E
./runseq.csh 6 F
./runseq.csh 7 G
./runseq.csh 8 H
./runseq.csh 9 I
./runseq.csh 10 J
./runseq.csh 11 K
./runseq.csh 12 L
./runseq.csh 13 M
./runseq.csh 14 N
./runseq.csh 15 O
./runseq.csh 16 P
./runseq.csh 17 Q
./runseq.csh 18 R
./runseq.csh 19 S

The shell script "runseq.csh" contains:

#!/bin/csh
mkdir -p Run$1
cd Run$1
echo "hello, world" > Data$2
@ snooze = $1 * 2
echo "about to sleep for " $snooze >> Data$2
date >> Data$2
sleep $snooze
date >> Data$2
echo "done with sleep for " $snooze >> Data$2
exit


This example creates directories Run1, Run2, ... Run19; in each
directory it creates a file named DataA, DataB, ... DataS; these
files contain "hello, world", and an indication that each slave
then took a short nap.
